<strong>Objectives: </strong>

Variable declaration, simple arithmetic calculation, input, output

A car averages 22.5 miles per gallon when driven in town and 29.5 miles per gallon when driven on the highway. Write a program that calculates the gas consumption for a trip given the number of miles driven in town and on the highway.  Your program should ask the user to enter the number of miles driven in town and the number of miles driven on the highway. The program should then calculate and output the following:

<ul>

 <li>The number of miles driven in town</li>

 <li>The gas consumption for town driving</li>

 <li>The number of miles driven on the highway</li>

 <li>The gas consumption for highway driving</li>

 <li>The total number of miles driven</li>

 <li>The total gas consumption</li>

 <li>The average miles per gallon for the whole trip</li>

</ul>

<strong>Sample User Interaction: </strong>

Enter the number of miles driven in town: <strong>100</strong>

Enter the number of miles driven on the highway: <strong>150</strong>

————— Gas consumption ——————-

The number of miles driven in town: <strong>100</strong> miles

The gas consumption for town driving: <strong>4.44444</strong> gallons

The number of miles driven on the highway: <strong>150</strong> miles

The gas consumption for highway driving: <strong>5.08475</strong> gallons

The total miles driven: <strong>250</strong> miles

The total gas consumption: <strong>9.52919</strong> gallons

The average mpg for the trip: <strong>26.2352</strong> miles/gallon —————————————————
